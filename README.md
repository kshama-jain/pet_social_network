The Social Network for Pet Owners is a community-driven platform designed to connect pet owners, share experiences, discover pet-friendly services, and organize events. Built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, the system ensures a structured, maintainable, and scalable approach to development.

The Model represents key entities such as Users, Pets, Posts, and Groups, encapsulating business logic and data management. The View provides an interactive user interface for seamless engagement, while the Controller handles user requests, processes inputs, and updates the Model accordingly.

Core functionalities include user profile management, pet profile creation, social interactions (posts, likes, comments), and group/event management. The MVC structure enhances code reusability, maintainability, and separation of concerns, making it easier to extend features and integrate with databases and external services.

By leveraging modern web technologies, this platform aims to foster a dynamic and engaging online community for pet lovers, enabling meaningful connections and enriching the pet ownership experience.
